# Repo secrets

This directory contains secrets used during CI.

## `id_ed25519`

SSH key. Since the app has Git integration, this SSH key is used to access a
small number of repos used for testing purposes.

### Granting access to a GitHub repo

1. Copy the public key from `.github/workflows/secrets/id_ed25519.pub`
2. Visit the "Deploy keys" settings for the repo you wish to grant access to.
3. Choose to add a new key, and paste the public key. Ensure you allow write
   access.

The test suite should then be able to clone and push to the repo in CI.

### Regenerating the key

```sh
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f .github/workflows/secrets/id_ed25519 -C "maddy-portfolio" -N ""
# Generate encryption password (copy this output)
pwgen 32 1
# And encrypt it
openssl aes-256-cbc -in .github/workflows/secrets/id_ed25519 -out .github/workflows/secrets/id_ed25519.enc -pbkdf2
```

Make sure to update the `SSH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the repo's GitHub Actions
secrets settings. Its value should be set to the password you copied.
